The "Test" folder is the place where all the submissions made to MOJO will be temporarily stored and judged.

Each submission will have their own folder with the name same as the submission ID. Inside each submission folder, there would be the source code with the name same as submission ID and also compiled object file of the same name (in case of compiled languages like C and C++). Java on the other hand would have a separate .class file with the name of the class and therefore would be detected by the Java 8 File API.

This folder is an important place where all the submissions would remain in folders, beautifully segmented, after the competition
is over. These source codes could be used to test against plagiarism.
